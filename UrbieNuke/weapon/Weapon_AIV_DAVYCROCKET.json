The Davy Crockett-I is a one-shot infantry support weapon carried at the platoon level. Besides the warhead itself this version includes a special launcher system and booster rockets, weighing in total three tons. Unfortunately, the Davy Crockett-I has a maximum range of a little over one kilometer, which means the attacking infantry are as likely to be caught within the blast effect as the defenders are; as such they are not popular among the troops. The Davy Crockett-M meanwhile, can be launched via Arrow IV or Long Tom and, while heavier than normal rounds at one ton each, behave exactly as their normal munitions do. Both versions of the Davy Crockett operate in ground-burst mode only. <b><color=#F79232>10 rounds.</color></b>",
