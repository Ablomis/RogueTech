The Vargr (meaning Wolf in old Norse), is capable of carrying two full platoons of infantry into combat.

Tracked: Not the fastest but better than wheels in rough terrain.
Wheeled: Efficient and agile, but has trouble in rough terrain.
Hover: Fast movement over any unobstructed terrain, including water.
VTOL: Flying allows a unit to completely ignore terrain. Greatly reduced movement in vacuum.

ICE: Air breathing Internal Combustion Engine prevents this unit from deploying in vacuum.
Fuel Cell: This unit is powered by a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell and can operate in vacuum.
Fusion: This unit is powered by a fusion core and can operate in vacuum.
