0.3.2 - 3/15/2019

Removed hardcoded pilot settings from superheavy contracts giving it back to the lances. This allows some of the extra-high skill elite pilots to spawn if the lance calls for them. As well as matching tanker crews with vehicles.
Removed requirement for Smooth Stones completion before Peer Review can generate.
