    "Description" : "ComStar, the institution and religion, grew out of the Star League Department of Communications, as reenvisioned by Jerome Blake, Minister of Communications. ComStar is transnational, beholden to none of the Successor States, and its priesthood exclusively controls access to the only means of faster-than-light communications, the HyperPulse Generators. ComStar facilities and personnel are sacrosanct, a status enforced aggressively by the institution; offending states\u2014even entire Successor States\u2014can find themselves cut off from the rest of the Inner Sphere, unable to communicate or trade. The current head of ComStar is Primus Julian Tiepolo.",
