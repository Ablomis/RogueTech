      "Details": "This is a kinetic energy penetrator, it's damage is velocity dependant so it decreases with range. And while it does a good job vs armor the lack of explosive makes it less impressive at damaging internal systems than a HEAT round, and the increasing importance of shot placement is abstracted with variable damage.",
