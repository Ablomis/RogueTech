VTOL external hardpoint rules. Tac Ops p.108

bombing Like aerospace fi ghters, VTOLs may carry bombs on external racks, 
using those rules (see p. 245, TW); Safe Thrust Reductions are applied as 
Cruising MP reductions for VTOLs. A VTOL may make only one bombing attack per turn, 
and may not make weapons or strafi ng attacks in the same turn. As with strafing, 
the controlling player declares the bombing attack during the Movement Phase. 
The player indicates the target hex, which must be one that the VTOL flew over during that turn. 
Though the VTOL may only strike one target hex, it may drop as many bombs as the player desires in that hex in a single turn.
The attack is resolved at the end of the Weapon Attack Phase after all other attacks have been resolved 
(if there are multiple VTOL strafi ng/dive-bombing attacks, randomly determine the order in which they are resolved), 
in the same manner as an aerospace fi ghterâ€™s dive-bombing attack (see p. 245, TW). Note that unlike an aerospace fighter, 
which changes altitude during a divebombing attack a VTOL does not change elevations during a dive-bombing attack.
