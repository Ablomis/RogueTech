Assigned to the Ghost Regiments and the Legions of Vega, these Cicadas are typically employed as scout-skirmishers and scout hunters. Unfortunately the limited ammo and lack of serious protection has lead to many mechwarriors petitioning for reassignment to other units or refusing to pilot these mechs. The Procurement Department on the other hand, is thrilled that it can offload these retrofitted Cicadas to units who have no choice in the matter. Nonetheless pilots who can master this design, report satisfaction with it\u2019s performance and many have turned to field conversions to improve it\u2019s endurance. The most commonly one reported is the installation of an Endosteel skeleton allowing another ton of ammo or the installation CASE II. <b><color=#53ff1a>Restricted Actuators- Left: Upper, Right: Upper</color></b>",
