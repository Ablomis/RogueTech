Disorderly Withdrawl
    If you don't get to the evac Sumire says she won't be able to pick you up for another X rounds. This is not true, the zone remains active.
    You can keep re-clicking Withdraw even after it changes to say "In X Rounds" and it will reset the timer each time.
    Does the actual zone on map have anything to do with the delay sumire talks about?
    Is MC and DW conflicting?
    What exactly is going on???

Put a generic sensors item on tanks.
