Heavy Ferro armour offered increased protection against counter battery fire and shaved some weight off the original chassis. The UL Gyro and CXXL engine provided just enough free room to squeeze in a Sniper Artillery piece and 3 tons of ammo. Unfortunately, this design lacks the case and ER small of the 100X, though the increased range of the Sniper should be more than enough to keep it off the front lines. The limited supply of CXXL engines and the high cost of the mech, rendered the Urbie as little more than an unrealized concept piece. The First Cappelan Defence Force gained custody of the few prototypes, were they served with some distinction over the years. <b><color=#53ff1a>Restricted Actuators- Left: Upper, Right: Upper</color></b>",
