The new active probe is capable of spotting most threats long before they can see the Wasp, whilst the removal of the RL-15 takes away most of it\u2019s offence punch, it allows for the addition of a knock-off AMS system to better protect the mech. Endo Steel is used to provide the weight savings for the probe, though it\u2019s limited availability and high cost limit the number of these conversions produced.
