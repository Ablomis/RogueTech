Clan weapon notes:

Superior clan weapons given baseline balance by being ~25% hotter than IS equivilents.

---- 2/28/2020, Cargo_Vroom
Clan weapons set to lore ranges with the following exceptions

Not Touched because obvious balance issues
    Weapon_Gauss_Magshot_Clan <--
    Weapon_Flamer_Flamer_CLAN <----more range but also falloff?
    Weapon_Laser_Light_TAG_CLAN <---- Just so different
    Machine guns <---- We buffed them a lot, might need a look but skipped for now.

    Clan Medium Pulse because it's a god weapon on TT because reasons.

Things Touched but not set to canon:
    STUPID CLAN SMALL AND MICRO LASERS BECAUSE THE OFFICIAL VERSIONS MAKE NO SENSE.
    Set so ER's are longer than standard/pulse
    Set so pulses are shorter range than normal or ER in same bracket.
