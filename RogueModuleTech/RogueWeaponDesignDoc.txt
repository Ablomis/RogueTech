General Weapon Notes:
    Maximum range is twice Medium Range

Canonical ranges of small lasers are very short. We had them buffed before I might not be opposed, i'm jsut resetting for now - Cargo

Primitive Weapon Notes:

>> 2/29/2020 - Cargo_Vroom

All the RL variants that matched the range of the basic RL already were given the new range of the basic RL
Heavy RL - adjusted relative to new basic RL values
Heavy AOE RL - Same as above.

Corrected weapon ranges to canon with the following exceptions:

MARS - Non canon arty, looked fine for type.
Howitzer 2000 - same as above
Mine Dispensers - non canon implementation

Clan weapon notes:

Superior clan weapons given baseline balance by being ~25% hotter than IS equivalents.

---- 2/28/2020, Cargo_Vroom
Clan weapons set to lore ranges with the following exceptions

Not Touched because obvious balance issues
    Weapon_Gauss_Magshot_Clan <--
    Weapon_Flamer_Flamer_CLAN <----more range but also falloff?
    Weapon_Laser_Light_TAG_CLAN <---- Just so different
    Machine guns <---- We buffed them a lot, might need a look but skipped for now.

    Clan Medium Pulse because it's a god weapon on TT because reasons.

Things Touched but not set to canon:
    STUPID CLAN SMALL AND MICRO LASERS BECAUSE THE OFFICIAL VERSIONS MAKE NO SENSE.
    Set so ER's are longer than standard/pulse
    Set so pulses are shorter range than normal or ER in same bracket.
